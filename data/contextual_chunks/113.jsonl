Most codeine found in pharmaceutical products today is synthetically produced via the methylation of morphine. Codeine is available by prescription only in most areas of the US.

A example is 325 mg of acetaminophen/paracetamol (a unit dose of acetaminophen) and 8 mg codeine per tablet. This law is used to prevent the excessive use of codeine as one would have to take doses reaching toxicity of acetaminophen before any real problems with the codeine administration would occur.

(Most sources recommend that codeine not be stored at temperatures in excess of 40C (104F), so its probably better to use warm, but not hot, water. I find that it is best to crash the tablets completely in a container, and then dissolve them in a glass with water.) 3. Place the solution in a cold bath, I just use some ice cubes in a container of water. Stir the mixture occasionally until the solution drops to about 15C or lower. You won't need a thermometer to measure the temperature, just make sure it's \"cold\". This will take about 30 min.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears within the step-by-step procedure for extracting codeine from over-the-counter tablets containing acetaminophen or aspirin.

If you wish to speed this up, you can use less water to dissolve the tablets, and add ice chips to cool the mixture faster. Just make sure you don't add so much ice that you drastically increase the volume of the mixture. 4. Filter the solution using whatever you have. Coffee filters work well, but lab filters work the best. Just make sure you don't end up with obvious solids in the filtered solution. This will take about 1 hr. You may also want to rinse the solids left over in the filter with some ice-water to extract any remaining codeine. (With aspirin this will take only about 20-30 minutes.)

The Merck index warns that codeine is sensitive to heat and light. For that reason if you wish to evaporate the mixture, do it without heat, and shield the solution from light. In order to take full advantage of codeine, it is helpful to be familiar with some relevant pharmacology: *CYP2D6 The body converts codeine into morphine (~10%) by using the so called P450 cytochrome pathway, especially cytochrome 2d6 (cyp2d6). Unfortunately, cyp2d6 is missing in about 7% of the white population, and its manifestation is quite variable in the rest. Individuals who inherited a cyp2d6 deficiency will get many of the adverse effects associated with codeine but little euphoria. If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6.

If codeine just doesn't work for you, this may be why. Some drugs also interfere with cyp2d6. Prime among these are the SSRIs, with the exception of Zoloft (if I remember correctly). The most potent inhibitor is paroxetine (paxil), followed by fluoxetine (prozac). If you are taking an SSRI, you will probably experience a markedly decreased euphoria when using codeine. (Paxil has a half life of only 24hrs, so not taking it for a few days will do miracles; the half life of prozac is 7 days.) Finally, codeine itself is a cyp2d6 inhibitor. This means that taking the whole dose as quickly as possible will probably give you the biggest high (ie. its a waste to redose in 30 mins). *GLUTHETHIMIDE A combination of codeine and gluthethimide (a sleeping agent) has been used in some places as a heroin substitute. Gluthethimide is an enzyme-inducer, and it allows the body to convert more than 10% of codeine into morphine.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This passage appears in a section of the historical Erowid Codeine FAQ that discusses the pharmacology of codeine, specifically how the body metabolizes codeine into morphine via the CYP2D6 enzyme.

Amphetamines generally cause strong physical and mental stimulation, keeping users awake and alert for many hours, and some amphetamines cause mood lift / euphoria. Because they increase wakefulness, various amphetamines have been used by the military, by pilots, truck drivers, and other workers to keep functioning past their normal limits. Amphetamines are also used to treat Attention Deficit Disorder and can have the seemingly paradoxical effect of quieting and calming users. Common amphetamines include Dexedrine (d-amphetamine), methamphetamine, and adderall (dl-amphetamine). Substantial amounts of pharmaceutical amphetamines are diverted from medical use to recreational and work-related uses and methamphetamine is produced in huge quantities in underground labs around the world.\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk is from the \"Amphetamine Basics\" section of Erowid's comprehensive index on psychoactive substances, specifically within the Chemicals > Amphetamines vault.

The content serves as a general introduction to amphetamines, situating them within broader information on chemistry, history, effects, law, and related substances available elsewhere in the document.\n                "}

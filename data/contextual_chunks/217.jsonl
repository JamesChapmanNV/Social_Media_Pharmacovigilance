This means it is illegal to sell without a DEA license and illegal to buy or possess without a license or prescription. After high-dose oxycodone tablets as OxyContin were approved in 2005, the FDA revoked its approval of the original sustained-release formulation in 2010 because of the record of unapproved use. A re-engineered OxyContin product was released to try to make it harder to snort or inject and in April 2013, the FDA approved a newer formulation that is even harder to snort or inject.

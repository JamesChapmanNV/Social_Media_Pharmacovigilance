Deaths from oxycodone alone or in combination with other CNS depressants [data?] Although the death rate from opioids increased between 1999 and 2011, the rate of increase has slowed since 2006.[1]\n\nWARNINGS #\n\nRespiratory Depression. Respiratory depression from taking too much oxycodone or mixing it with other CNS depressants can have life-threatening consequences. [grabbed from Alcohol Health] Seek medical attention if : The person is unconscious and cannot be wakened Breathing is irregular and/or shallow You suspect oxycodone has been mixed with other drugs Skin is clammy or pale\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears within Erowid's informational page on oxycodone under the Pharmaceuticals section, following general site navigation and donation information.

Avoid other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opiates, some dissociatives) in combination with oxycodone, which can increase respiratory depressions risks.\n\nOxycodone is Addicting. Oxycodone is an opiate and, as with most opiates, is addicting. Some people find opiates very appealing and with even moderate use, can find themselves using more than they want to. With regular use, the body becomes physically dependent upon the substance, causing withdrawal symptoms if use is ceased.\n\nOxycodone Causes Tolerance. Those who use Oxycodone for many days in a row report that they begin to require a higher dose for the same effects. Beware of dosages recommended by an individual who uses Oxycodone regularly as their dose could be dangerous for a non-user due to tolerance.\n\nCAUTIONS #\n\n\n                    Context: \n                    This chunk appears in an Erowid informational page about oxycodone within the Pharmaceuticals section.

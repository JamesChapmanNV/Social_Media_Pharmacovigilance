      "First, I need to look at the post: \"steal the night K WORD the lights feel it under your skin time is right uhhh Cuz its pulling you in pump it up you cant stop cuz it feels like an overdose FEELS LIKE AN OVERDOOOSE Bah BAh evacuate the dance floor bah bah im infected by the sound\". \n",

      "I need to scan each word or phrase for possible drug references. Let's break it down. The phrase \"K WORD\" might be a slang term. Looking at the index terms, \"K\" is a common slang for cocaine, but cocaine isn't listed here. Wait, the index terms include \"Codeine\" with synonyms like \"Lean\", but \"K\" might refer to \"Ketamine\" (Special K). Let me check the index terms. Yes, \"Ketamine\" is listed with synonyms like Special K, Keta, Ketalar. So \"K WORD\" could be a reference to Ketamine. But the exact phrase is \"K WORD\". However, the index term for Ketamine is \"Ketamine\", so \"K\" might be part of the matched phrase. But the user's example had \"Lean\" linked to Codeine. So \"K\" could be a slang for Ketamine. But the index term is \"Ketamine\", so \"K\" would be the matched phrase. But wait, the index term for Ketamine is listed as \"Ketamine (Special K, Keta, Ketalar)\", so \"K\" is a synonym. So \"K WORD\" would be \"K\" as the matched phrase, linked to \"Ketamine\". But the user's example had \"Lean\" linked to Codeine, which is a synonym. So \"K\" would be the matched phrase here. However, the post says \"K WORD\", but the exact phrase is \"K WORD\". But maybe \"K\" is the key part. Alternatively, \"K WORD\" could be a reference to \"K\" as a slang term. But the exact phrase is \"K WORD\", but the index terms don't have \"K WORD\" as a term. However, \"K\" is a synonym for Ketamine. So the matched phrase would be \"K\", and the index term is \"Ketamine\". But the user's example had \"Lean\" linked to Codeine. So in this case, \"K\" would be the matched phrase, and the index term is \"Ketamine\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, \"overdose\" is mentioned. The index terms don't have a specific term for overdose, but the task says if the drug is not in the list, use \"other\". However, \"overdose\" itself is not a drug, but a consequence. However, the user's example 4 had \"snow\" and \"white lines\" as \"other\". So \"overdose\" might not be a drug reference but a consequence. But in the context of the post, \"feels like an overdose\" could be a reference to drug use. However, the task is to detect references to drugs, not the effects. So \"overdose\" is not a drug, so it would be \"other\". But the user's example 3 had \"xans\" as \"other\" because it's not in the list. So \"overdose\" is not a drug, so \"other\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Another part is \"pump it up you can't stop\". This is more about the effect of a drug, but not a specific drug name. So \"pump it up\" might be a slang term. But looking at the index terms, \"pump\" is not listed. So \"pump\" would be \"other\". But the user's example 3 had \"xans\" as \"other\". So \"pump\" would be \"other\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase \"feels like an overdose\" is a consequence, not a drug name. So \"overdose\" is \"other\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the post: \"steal the night\", \"the lights feel it under your skin\", \"time is right\", \"evacuate the dance floor\", \"im infected by the sound\". These are more metaphorical and not drug references. So the only possible drug references are \"K WORD\" (K as Ketamine) and \"overdose\" (but that's not a drug). Wait, but \"overdose\" is not a drug, so it's \"other\". So the only match is \"K WORD\" as \"K\" linked to \"Ketamine\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but \"K WORD\" is a phrase. The index term for Ketamine is \"Ketamine (Special K, Keta, Ketalar)\". So \"K\" is a synonym. So \"K WORD\" would have \"K\" as the matched phrase. But the exact phrase is \"K WORD\", but the matched phrase should be the exact text. However, the user's example 1 had \"lean\" as the matched phrase. So if the post says \"K WORD\", then the matched phrase is \"K WORD\", but the index term is \"Ketamine\". But the index term for Ketamine includes \"K\" as a synonym. So \"K\" is part of the matched phrase. But the exact text is \"K WORD\". However, the task says to detect every word or phrase. So maybe \"K\" is the part that refers to the drug. But the user's example 1 had \"lean\" as the matched phrase. So if the post has \"K WORD\", maybe \"K\" is the matched phrase. But the exact text is \"K WORD\". However, the user's example 1 had \"lean\" as the matched phrase. So in this case, the exact phrase is \"K WORD\", but the relevant part is \"K\". But the task says to include the exact text. So if \"K WORD\" is the phrase, but \"K\" is the part that refers to the drug, then the matched phrase would be \"K\". But the user's example 1 had \"lean\" as the matched phrase, which is the exact text. So in this case, the matched phrase would be \"K\", but the post has \"K WORD\". However, the user's example 1 had \"lean\" as the matched phrase, which is the exact text. So maybe \"K\" is the matched phrase. But the post has \"K WORD\".

      "\n",
      "Looking at the index terms, the only entries related to mushrooms are \"Psilocybin\" and \"Psilocin\". The post says \"shrooms\", which is a common slang for psilocybin mushrooms. However, the index terms don't have a specific term for \"shrooms\". Therefore, the correct approach would be to check if \"shrooms\" is a synonym for any of the index terms. Since \"shrooms\" is a slang for psilocybin, which is in the index terms, but the exact phrase \"shrooms\" isn't listed. However, the user's instruction says to use the index terms as given. So if \"shrooms\" isn't an exact match, but refers to psilocybin, which is in the index terms, but the exact phrase \"shrooms\" isn't listed. Wait, but the example given in the problem includes \"shrooms\" in the index terms? Wait, no. Looking back, the index terms include \"Psilocybin (4-PO-DMT)\" and \"Psilocin (4-HO-DMT)\", but not \"shrooms\". Therefore, the phrase \"shrooms\" would not be directly mapped to an index term. But in the example provided in the problem, the user has an example where \"xans\" is not in the index terms and is mapped to \"other\". So in this case, \"shrooms\" would be considered as referring to psilocybin, which is in the index terms. But the problem is that the exact phrase \"shrooms\" is not in the index terms. However, the user's index terms list \"Psilocybin\" as an index term, so if the phrase \"shrooms\" is a synonym for psilocybin, then it should be mapped to \"Psilocybin\". But the problem is that the index terms list \"Psilocybin\" as a separate term. So the user might expect that \"shrooms\" is a synonym for psilocybin, but the index terms don't have \"shrooms\" as a direct term. However, the user's instruction says to link each detected phrase to its matching index term. So if \"shrooms\" refers to psilocybin, then the index term would be \"Psilocybin\". But in the index terms, \"Psilocybin\" is listed as a separate term. Therefore, the correct approach is to check if \"shrooms\" is a synonym for any of the index terms. Since \"shrooms\" is a slang for psilocybin, which is in the index terms, then \"shrooms\" should be mapped to \"Psilocybin\". However, the problem is that the user's index terms do not list \"shrooms\" as a term. Therefore, the answer would be that \"shrooms\" is not directly in the index terms, but refers to psilocybin. Wait, but the index terms have \"Psilocybin\" as an index term. Therefore, the phrase \"shrooms\" would be mapped to \"Psilocybin\". However, the user's example 4 shows that \"snow\" is mapped to \"other\" even though it's not a drug. So in this case, \"shrooms\" is a slang for psilocybin, which is in the index terms, so it should be mapped to \"Psilocybin\". Alternatively, maybe \"shrooms\" is not in the index terms, so it's considered \"other\". Wait, the index terms include \"Psilocybin\" and \"Psilocin\", but the phrase \"shrooms\" is not listed. Therefore, the correct answer would be that \"shrooms\" is not in the index terms, so it's \"other\". But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that \"shrooms\" refers to psilocybin, which is in the index terms. Therefore, the correct mapping is \"Psilocybin\" for \"shrooms\". But the problem is that the index terms don't have \"shrooms\" as a direct match. Therefore, the answer is that \"shrooms\" is mapped to \"Psilocybin\". But the user's example 3 shows that \"xans\" is mapped to \"other\" even though it's a benzodiazepine. So perhaps the user expects that if the phrase is not an exact match to the index terms, it's \"other\". Therefore, \"shrooms\" is not an exact match, but refers to psilocybin, which is in the index terms. However, the user's instruction says to link each detected phrase to its matching index term. If the phrase is a synonym, then it's allowed. But the index terms are the exact terms. Therefore, if \"shrooms\" is not in the index terms, then it's \"other\". However, the index terms have \"Psilocybin\" as a term. So the user might have intended that \"shrooms\" refers to psilocybin. Therefore, the correct answer would be to map \"shrooms\" to \"Psilocybin\". But how to confirm? Let me check the index terms again. The index terms include \"Psilocybin (4-PO-DMT)\" and \"Psilocin (4-HO-DMT)\" as separate entries. The post says \"shrooms\", which is a slang for psilocybin mushrooms. Therefore, \"shrooms\" is a synonym for psilocybin. Therefore, the correct index term is \"Psilocybin\". However, the user's example 3 shows that \"xans\" is mapped to \"other\", even though it's a benzodiazepine. But \"xans\" is a slang for Xanax, which is a benzodiazepine, but in the index terms, \"Bromazolam (XLI-268, Fake Xanax)\" is listed. So \"xans\" is not in the index terms, hence \"other\". Therefore, in this case, \"shrooms\" is not in the index terms, but refers to psilocybin, which is in the index terms. So the answer would be to map \"shrooms\" to \"Psilocybin\". However, the user's instruction says to link each detected phrase to its matching index term. So if \"shrooms\" is a synonym for psilocybin, then it's mapped to \"Psilocybin\". But the problem is that the index terms don't have \"shrooms\" as a direct match. Therefore, the correct answer would be to map \"shrooms\" to \"Psilocybin\" because it refers to psilocybin. But in the example given, \"xans\" is mapped to \"other\" because it's not in the index terms. Therefore, the answer here is that \"shrooms\" is mapped to \"Psilocybin\".
